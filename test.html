            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
            <div class="info-block">
                <h4>Problem</h4>
                <p>According to the deck, "AI's biggest obstacle to innovation is data quality," with less than 30% of demand being met. The key drivers for this market gap are low-quality data, slow iteration speeds, high costs, compliance challenges, complex operations, and the prevalence of generic solutions.</p>
                <h4>Solution</h4>
                <p>Perle's solution is a "transparent and modular self-serve platform" that replaces "black-box labeling." It provides end-to-end AI development workflow services, including data collection, annotation, quality assurance, and model evaluation. The platform is powered by a "vetted global crowd" of experts to ensure high-quality, specialized data services for complex tasks.</p>
